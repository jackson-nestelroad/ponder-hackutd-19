## About
**Ponder** is built with React JS and Firebase Realtime Database.

## The Challenge
As a part of **HackUTD**, our team of three had less than 24 hours to put together an application for submission.

While our application is not specifically geared towards a single competition, our focus was especially on **Cross-Compatability** between mobile and web clients and **Simplicity** in user interface.

Due to the incredibly-limited time constraint, the React code here is definitely not my cleanest work. With more time, I would have worked more on creating reusable components to be extended across the application. I also would have spent more time cleaning up animations and creating a more efficient environment in terms of rendering.
